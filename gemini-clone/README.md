# Gemini Clone

This project is a **front-end clone** of the Gemini AI interface by Google, built using only **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It simulates how users interact with a chatbot, allowing them to type prompts and see generated responses in a clean, Gemini-style layout. While it does not include real AI responses, the design mimics the experience of chatting with an AI.

## 🎯 Project Purpose

The main goal of this project is to:

- Practice front-end development using **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS**
- Recreate a modern, minimalistic UI similar to Google's Gemini
- Understand layout, styling, and DOM manipulation
- Prepare for integrating with real AI APIs in the future (optional)

This project is useful for students and beginners who want to learn UI/UX design, responsive layout, and front-end interactions **without relying on frameworks**.
